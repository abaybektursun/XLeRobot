# Dual wheel Assembly

Here briefly introduce how to build the dual wheel version.

(This page is still under construction)

### Servo motor version

Pros: 
- Compared to previous version: more stable, control is more accurate, less wiggle
- Compared to brushless version: still same servo motors, easier wiring and control

Cons:
- Compared to previous version: lose one Dof of moving left and right
- Compared to brushless version: still same servo motors, noisy, speed and torque not very high.

This can already be purchased at wowrobo. 

You can also buy parts yourself, what you need besides 3D printed parts and servo motors:

- Universal walker wheels (5 inches)
- 30 x 37 x 4mm Bearings
- longer Motor cables (or extension kit)

### Brushless motor version

Build upon [Bracket Bot](https://www.bracket.bot/).

Pros: a fully stable and robust version with great performance.

Cons: more complex wiring.
